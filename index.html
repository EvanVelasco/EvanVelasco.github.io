						<h2>About Me</h2>
						<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/evan_headshot.jpg" alt="" /></span> 
							Hello! My name is Evan Velasco. I am a digital analytics professional currently working as a Senior Analyst at the Washington Post. 
							I began my career focused on programmatic data and understanding the complex landscape of ad tech. Since then, I have continued to 
							gain knowledge of digital advertising as a whole. I am an extremely driven individual with a natural curiosity who is always 
							eager to learn something new. I received my B.S. in Joint Mathematics-Economics as well as a Minor in Business from UC San Diego.</p>

							<h2>My Day Job</h2>

							<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/wapo_logo.png" alt="" /></span> 
								I work as a Senior Analyst at The Washington Post supporting the Pricing and Sales Strategy team. Over the last two 
								years I have bounced between various advertising and technology teams all contributing to the Post's monetization efforts. 
								This has given me diveristy in experience and has helped me view problems from all angles. From a technical point of view, 
								I have strong experience providing data analysis in Excel, statistical analysis in R, building data pipelines in Python, and 
								querying massive databases using SQL. Conducting business in an online environment often means generating billions of datapoints. 
								I pride myself on my ability to work with Engineers to build scalable and impactful BI solutions.</p>

							<h2>Education</h2>

							<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/ucsd_logo.png" alt="" /></span> I am a proud graduate of UC San Diego where I receieved a B.S. in Joint Mathematics-Economics. The Math-Econ major is very broad and allows for flexibility depending on an individual's interests. I chose to focus my coursework on statistics which introduced me to the field of analytics and data science. I had the pleasure of taking multiple computational statistics courses based in R and data science courses in Python. My degree formed a strong foundation which I continue to build upon through self studying and professional experience. I am currently applying to graduate programs in the Analytics/Data Science field to continue my formal education.</p>

							<h2>Interests</h2>

							<h4>Currently Studying:</h4>
							<p>I am learning more about time series forecasting with the online textbook <a href="https://otexts.com/fpp3/" target="_blank"> Forecasting: Principles and Practice by Rob J Hyndman and George Athanasopoulos </a>. Using data to analyze trends and predict the future was one of the earliest concepts of data science I was exposed to during an undergraduate economics course. The thrill of prediction has stuck with me and I am enjoying the process of exploring various models using R.</p>

							<h4>Industry Topics:</h4>
							<p>Within the ad tech industry I am most interested in first party data solutions which allow for targeted advertising without compromising user privacy. With the looming threat of third party cookie deprecation and a continued push for data privacy legislation, I believe a strong first party targeting solution is an investment all publishers should be making. I am in the process of applying to various Masters programs with the hope of taking graduate coursework in NLP algorithms to gain a better understanding of contextual data products.</p>

							<h4>Hobbies:</h4>
							<p>Outside of my professional work, I love cooking (currently mastering the art of soup), baseball, and exploring Washington DC's countless historical sites. You will also catch me at the dog park with my small (but mighty) pup.</p>
