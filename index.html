						<h2>About Me</h2>
						<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/evan_headshot.jpg" alt="" /></span> 
							Hello! My name is Evan Velasco. I am a digital analytics professional currently working as a Senior Analyst at the Washington Post. 
							I began my career focused on programmatic data and understanding the complex landscape of ad tech. Since then, I have continued to 
							gain knowledge of digital advertising as a whole. I am an extremely driven individual with a natural curiosity who is always 
							eager to learn something new.</p>

							<h2>My Day Job</h2>

							<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/wapo_logo.png" alt="" /></span> 
								I work as a Senior Analyst at The Washington Post supporting the Pricing and Sales Strategy team. Over the last two 
								years I have bounced between various advertising and technology teams all contributing to the Post's monetization efforts. 
								This has given me diveristy in experience and has helped me view problems from all angles. From a technical point of view, 
								I have strong experience providing data analysis in Excel, statistical analysis in R, building data pipelines in Python, and 
								querying massive databases using SQL. Conducting business in an online environment often means generating billions of datapoints. 
								I pride myself on my ability to work with Engineers to build scalable and impactful BI solutions.</p>
							<hr />

							<h2>Education</h2>

							<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/gt_logo.png" alt="" /></span> 
								I am a current student at Georgia Tech pursuing a Masters of Science in Analytics. My decision to go back to school 
								was a natural progression as I continued to seek knowledge. I chose the program at Georgia Tech due to its academic 
								rigour and wide array of course choices. I am most interested in learning about the mathematics behind
								modeling algorithms. A few courses I am looking forward to include Optimization, Regression, and High Dimensional Data Analytics.
							</p>


							<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/ucsd_logo.png" alt="" /></span> 
								I am a proud graduate of UC San Diego where I receieved a B.S. in Joint Mathematics-Economics. 
								The Math-Econ major is very broad and allows for flexibility depending on an individual's 
								interests. I chose to focus my coursework on statistics which introduced me to the field of analytics and data science. 
								I had the pleasure of taking multiple computational statistics courses based in R and data science courses in Python. I paired my applied statistical courses with rigrous mathmematical theory, including multiple coures in real analysis.
								My degree formed a strong foundation which I continue to build upon through self studying and professional experience.

							<h2>Interests</h2>

							<h4>Currently Studying:</h4>
							<p>
								<b>Intro to Computing for Analytics:</b> This course focuses on building end to end analytics pipelines "from scratch" using Python. I've used Python for automation in a variety of different projects in my professional work. I am hoping to come out of this course with a much stronger understanding of data structures and production code. Historically, I have always preferred R for scripting, analysis, and visualization due to my background in mathematics. This course may be the one which converts me! Check back on my portfolio in ~6 months to find the answer.  <br>

								<b>Deterministic Optimization: Optimization is one of my most anticipated courses in the OMSA program. It covers concepts, models, and algorithms in linear optimization, integer optimization, and convex optimization. I am particularly interested in optimization as a topic since nearly all analytical models use some form of optimization on the back end. After taking simulation, I am also extremely interested in learning more about methods in stochastic optimization. This course fits nicely with expected future coursework in computational analytics, high dimensional analytics, and deep learning. </b>

							<h4>Industry Topics:</h4>
							<p>Within the ads industry I have a wide array of interests ranging from programmatic auction mechanisms to first party data solutions. In 2024 I am most excited to see how Google's deprecation of 1st party cookies effects the overall ad ecosystem. Specifically, I am curious about how this change will affect publishers' monetization strategy and which alternative identity solutions (if any) rise to the top of the market.
							</p>

							<h4>Hobbies:</h4>
							<p>Outside of my professional work, I love cooking (currently mastering the art of soup), baseball, and exploring Washington DC's countless historical sites. You will also catch me at the dog park with my small (but mighty) pup.</p>
