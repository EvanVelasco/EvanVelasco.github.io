						<h2>About Me</h2>
						<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/evan_headshot.jpg" alt="" /></span> 
							Hello! My name is Evan Velasco. I am a digital analytics professional currently working as a Data Solutions Manager at Instacart. 
							I began my career focused on programmatic data and understanding the complex landscape of ad tech. Since then, I have continued to 
							gain knowledge of digital advertising as a whole. I am an extremely driven individual with a natural curiosity who is always 
							eager to learn something new.</p>

							<h2>My Day Job</h2>

							<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/instacart_logo.jpeg" alt="" /></span> 
								I currently work as a Data Solutions Manager at Instacart. I lead all off-platform and ad-tech initiatives for 
								the Data Solutions team. This includes Audience Enablement Operations, Audience Targeting Research & Experimentation, 
								Scaled/Syndicated Audiences, and Audience Refresh Management. 
								Being able to combine my analytical skill set with the automation capabilities of Data Solutions developers, our 
								team is building best in class, scalable solutions for a growing business.
							</p>

							<h2>Education</h2>

							<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/gt_logo.png" alt="" /></span> 
								I am a current student at Georgia Tech pursuing a Masters of Science in Analytics. My decision to go back to school 
								was a natural progression as I continued to seek knowledge. I chose the program at Georgia Tech due to its academic 
								rigour and wide array of course choices. I am most interested in learning about the mathematics behind
								modeling algorithms. A few courses I am looking forward to include Optimization, Regression, and High Dimensional Data Analytics.
							</p>


							<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/ucsd_logo.png" alt="" /></span> 
								I am a proud graduate of UC San Diego where I received a B.S. in Joint Mathematics-Economics. 
								The Math-Econ major is very broad and allows for flexibility depending on an individual's 
								interests. I chose to focus my coursework on statistics which introduced me to the field of analytics and data science. 
								I had the pleasure of taking multiple computational statistics courses based in R and data science courses in Python. I paired my applied statistical courses with rigorous mathematical theory, including multiple courses in real analysis.
								My degree formed a strong foundation which I continue to build upon through self studying and professional experience.

							<h2>Interests</h2>

							<h4>Currently Studying:</h4>
							<p>
								<b>Computational Data Analysis (Machine Learning 1):</b> This course is a graduate introduction to machine learning, covering classical methods in both supervised and unsupervised learning. This is known as one of the highlight courses of the program, and so far I have been extremely impressed. Algorithms taught in the class are presented in great detail, with derivations and proofs for all aspects. This is a fantastic course to study after spending 5+ years in higher education covering topics like mathematics, statistics, optimization, and computer science. Everything comes together in this class.<br>
							</p>

							<p>
								<b>Market Segmentation Analysis:</b> In my free time, I am also reading through the book "Market Segmentation Analysis - Understanding It, Doing It, and Making It Useful" by Sara Dolnicar, Bettina Grün, and Friedrich Leisch. This is a great topic, and something that I think deserves more attention. Market segmentation is often brought up when students learn their first clustering algorithm. However, the reality is that building useful segmentation strategies is a difficult task. Unsupervised learning can give the illusion of simplicity, because your algorithm will always return a result. This book discusses the segmentation process in detail, including algorithms and validation techniques. One of my favorite aspects of this book is that it focuses on audience segmentation when no “natural” clusters exist, which is the reality in most business cases. You can download this book from Springer <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-981-10-8818-6", target="_blank">HERE</a>.

							<h4>Industry Topics:</h4>
							<p>Within the ads industry I have a wide array of interests ranging from programmatic auction mechanisms to first party data solutions. In 2024 I am most excited to learn more about leveraging data cleanrooms for measurement and data collaberation in ad tech. 
							</p>

							<h4>Hobbies:</h4>
							<p>Outside of my professional work, I love cooking (currently mastering the art of soup), baseball, and exploring Washington DC's countless historical sites. You will also catch me at the dog park with my small (but mighty) pup.</p>
