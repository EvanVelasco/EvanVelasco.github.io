						<h2>About Me</h2>
						<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/evan_headshot.jpg" alt="" /></span> 
							Hello! My name is Evan Velasco. I am a digital analytics professional currently working as a Data Solutions Manager at Instacart. 
							I began my career focused on programmatic data and understanding the complex landscape of ad tech. Since then, I have continued to 
							gain knowledge of digital advertising as a whole. I am an extremely driven individual with a natural curiosity who is always 
							eager to learn something new.</p>

							<h2>My Day Job</h2>

							<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/instacart_logo.jpeg" alt="" /></span> 
								I recently started a new position as a Data Solutions Manager at Instacart. I am excited to join the team and help build out best in class ad technology to power their retail media network. It is an exciting time to be joining retail media as there has been tremendous growth in the channel. I am looking forward to seeing how my experience in programmatic, 1P/3P targeting systems, and ad platforms can contribute to my new role.</p>
							<hr />

							<h2>Education</h2>

							<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/gt_logo.png" alt="" /></span> 
								I am a current student at Georgia Tech pursuing a Masters of Science in Analytics. My decision to go back to school 
								was a natural progression as I continued to seek knowledge. I chose the program at Georgia Tech due to its academic 
								rigour and wide array of course choices. I am most interested in learning about the mathematics behind
								modeling algorithms. A few courses I am looking forward to include Optimization, Regression, and High Dimensional Data Analytics.
							</p>


							<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/ucsd_logo.png" alt="" /></span> 
								I am a proud graduate of UC San Diego where I received a B.S. in Joint Mathematics-Economics. 
								The Math-Econ major is very broad and allows for flexibility depending on an individual's 
								interests. I chose to focus my coursework on statistics which introduced me to the field of analytics and data science. 
								I had the pleasure of taking multiple computational statistics courses based in R and data science courses in Python. I paired my applied statistical courses with rigorous mathematical theory, including multiple courses in real analysis.
								My degree formed a strong foundation which I continue to build upon through self studying and professional experience.

							<h2>Interests</h2>

							<h4>Currently Studying:</h4>
							<p>
								<b>Data Analytics for Business:</b> This course covers methodologies, algorithms, and challenges related to analyzing business data. After many years of experience handling business data, much of the course content feels like a refresher. However, I am seizing this opportunity to explore foundational analytical concepts in greater depth. For example, I've taken the initiative to delve into the mathematical intricacies of the box cox transformation, extending beyond course materials. I have also spent time building algorithms from scratch to compute and showcase metadata for common analytical methods such as the variance inflation factor (VIF).<br>
							</p>

							<p>
								<b>Sampling Theory and Methods:</b> A lighter courseload has given me the time to study material outside of the OMSA curriculum. I've been reviewing sampling methodologies using the textbook <i>Sampling</i> by Thompson along with <a href="https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat506/" target="_blank">Penn State University's online course notes.</a> My renewed interest in this subject was driven by recent applications of sampling I have seen at work. I am particularly interested in getting a more formal education in sampling techniques outside of simple random, such as stratified and cluster samples.


							</p>

							<h4>Industry Topics:</h4>
							<p>Within the ads industry I have a wide array of interests ranging from programmatic auction mechanisms to first party data solutions. In 2024 I am most excited to learn more about leveraging data cleanrooms for measurement and data collaberation in ad tech. 
							</p>

							<h4>Hobbies:</h4>
							<p>Outside of my professional work, I love cooking (currently mastering the art of soup), baseball, and exploring Washington DC's countless historical sites. You will also catch me at the dog park with my small (but mighty) pup.</p>
